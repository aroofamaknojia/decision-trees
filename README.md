Building a classification model that predicts the edibility of mushrooms
Process to get to the classification tree:
1. Read the dataset and explore the data to determine the dependent variable
2. Store the feature and target variables
3. Convert all categorical variables to dummy variables
4. Partition the dataset to training and testing data
5. Fit the training data into a classification tree

Analysis of the tree:
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Accuracy Scores
3. Feature Importance
